# config

Just my config files

## What it includes

- starship prompt configs
- neovim config & vim-extensions
- vscode extensions I use(d)
- shell config
  - bash
  - elvish
  - nushell

## shell

I use bash and [elvish](https://elv.sh/) as shell.

> [!note]
> I used to use [nushell](https://www.nushell.sh), but got bored of it
> for various reasons.
> But mainly because I did not like to use the way I use it as a own
> programming language and not like a "dumber" shell scripting language.
